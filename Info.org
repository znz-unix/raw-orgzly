> capabilities: 100 km range, swarm capabile
> "certified": battle-tested, scalable and fully certified
> notification: 
 * FV-014's fuselage is rather unusual. Besides a distinctive fin, it features sharp faceted shapes. Those could indicate design choices aimed at radar cross-section reduction, or they might simply be driven by the fuselage manufacturing technology.
 * claim does not square perfectly with the company's wording that its UAVs are battle-tested. Given that contradiction, the cautious inference is that FV-014 prototypes may indeed have been trialed in real combat conditions and the only realistic test range for that would be the russia–Ukraine war.

**** what it is

Bilateralism is the conduct of political, economic, or cultural relations between two sovereign states

common examples
2 state Economic agreements ->
free trade agreements (FTAs) 
foreign direct investment (FDI)

**** examples

Australia and Canada
⌀ In 1895 the Government of Canada sent John Larke to Sydney to establish a trade commission
⌀ in 1935 Canada sent Charles Burchell (Australia's first Canadian High Commissioner) to formalise ties between the two countries.

India and Nepal
⌀ had a bilateral relationship since ancient times even before the birth of the Buddha in 563 BC.
⌀ The India-Nepal treaty of friendship was signed in July 1950 and provides economically and politically important effects for both countries. 
⌀ In 2011, the two countries signed a new Bilateral Investment Promotion and Protection Agreement. These bilateral treaties have played a significant role in the evolution of international investment law. 

U.S. with South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan
⌀ The United States formed a bilateral alliance with Japan during the Security Treaty between the United States and Japan.
⌀ The U.S. also formed a bilateral alliance with Korea during the 1953 U.S.–South Korea Status of Forces Agreement
⌀ The U.S. also formed a bilateral alliance with the Republic of China during the 1954 Sino-American Mutual Defense Treaty.

**** benefits and uses

Benefit and Use
Unlike its relationship with European nations which takes multilateral alliances centered in NATO, the U.S. prefers a direct relationship with each of the East Asian countries.

Reason
> To avoid conflict, as might have been the case with multilateral treaties (e.g. risk of multilateral treaty defects)

factors
> (difference)
⌀ countries in the East Asian region can be an opponent or a target to any other. Therefore, it is comparatively difficult to construct multilateral alliances, which depend upon mutual reliance

> (relationship) comparing East Asia to Europe.
⌀ the United States had existing and longer relations with countries in Europe
⌀ where in East Asia relationships are just forming

leading difficulty making bonds and connections


> (geography) comparing East Asia to Europe. 
⌀ Because Europe is "connected", it is better for the security and economy. Whereas in East Asia it doesn't exist.
⌀ states are divided over a large space and is separated by large amounts of water and distance, 

making it a less admirable condition to form multilateral bonds


> (governance) comparing East Asia to Europe
⌀ there is variety of regimes: communist, authoritarian regimes as well as democratic regimes. 
⌀ In comparison to the states in NATO, who consist of democracies,

causing a level of difficulty in creating multilateral relations


> (Alignment) comparing East Asia to Europe
⌀ the states in NATO recognised the same source of threat, which was USSR. This allowed for an agreement amongst these NATO states to form this multilateral relation. 
⌀ However, in the case with East Asia, there was no unified threat.
  For the ROC (Republic of China/Taiwan), China was seen as the threat. 
  For the ROK (Republic of Korea/South Korea), DPRK (Democratic People's Republic of Korea/North Korea) was the threat.

Thus there was a great level of difficulty in the United States forming an alliance with East Asia as the threats were different.


> (Beliefs) comparing East Asia to Europe
⌀ social historians added that the U.S. decision makers firmly believed that unlike "superior" Europe who possess sophistication and responsibility that was required for the complex organization of the multilateral security arrangements.
⌀ the "inferior" Asians presumably did not this sophistication and responsibility that was required for the complex organization of the multilateral security arrangements.

no search of making multilateral agreements in East Asia


(Powerplay theory by Victor Cha)
Powerplay is commonly used in any political or social situation when one uses its knowledge or information against others in order to gain benefits using situational advantages the one has.
it explains the reasons behind the United States' decision in creating a series of bilateral alliances with East Asian countries.

⌀ the alliances were created to both contain and constrain potential rogue allies (rogue state) from performing aggressive behavior that would trigger larger military conflict and involvement.
  The rogue allies (rogue states) include Taiwan's Kai Shek Chiang, who was publicly planning and looking forward to take back mainland China
  Korea's Syngman Rhee, who wanted to unify the Korean peninsula. 
  The United States was also worried that Japan would recover its regional power in Asia. 

Cha concludes that the postwar United States planners had selected such a type of security architecture as an attempt to prevent aggression by the East Asian pro-west dictators and to increase leverage and states' dependency on the U.S. economy.


(US history of Bilateral agreements)
⌀ US set up a bilateral agreements with Panama, beginning with the Hay–Bunau-Varilla Treaty (1903) which established the United States' right to build a canal and own it and adjacent property across the otherwise-sovereign nation of Panama.

the US willing to set up bilateral agreements rather than creating a new method of agreements


Benefits
> separate allies
> being very simple

Cons
> Limited (only 2 states)
> extraneous (formation of multiple treaties, when doing multiple countries)
